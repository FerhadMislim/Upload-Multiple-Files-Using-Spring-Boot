<h1> Upload-Multiple-Files-Using-Spring-Boot</h1>
<p>I am going to upload multiple files using spring boot. These files will be uploaded to the root of this project itself by generating a folder named “uploads”.
The project has two html pages  uploadFiles.html (upload form for files) and uploadStatus.html(showing the upload details)</p>
